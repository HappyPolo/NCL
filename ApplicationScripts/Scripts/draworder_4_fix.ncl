; draworder_4_fix.ncl - this is a fix for draworder_4.ncl,
;   which won't work with versions V5.1.1 or earlier
;
; Concepts illustrated:
;   - Controlling the draw order of polygons, lines, and markers
;   - Attaching an outlined box to a map plot
;   - Attaching filled polygons to a map plot
;   - Filling in polygons with a shaded pattern
;   - Changing the color and thickness of polylines
;   - Changing the color of a filled polygon
;   - Changing the density of a fill pattern
;   - Creating a special "LogLin" object
